### What is Blockchain?
Blockchain is a decentralized, tamper-proof digital ledger that records transactions securely across multiple computers. Once data is added to the blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted, making it highly secure and transparent.
How Blockchain Helps Prevent Cheating in Attendance?
The main issue with traditional QR-based attendance systems is that students can share the QR code with others who are not physically present. Blockchain helps prevent this by ensuring that only legitimate students can sign in and that records cannot be manipulated.
Key Benefits of Blockchain for Attendance:
Immutable Records – Attendance data is stored on the blockchain, preventing anyone from modifying or deleting it.
Unique Digital Signatures – Each attendance entry is signed with a private key, ensuring authenticity.
Geofencing Integration – Only students physically present in the classroom can mark attendance.
Transparent & Auditable – Admins can verify attendance records at any time.
How the System Works (End-to-End Process)
Student Scans QR Code
The QR code opens an attendance form.
System Checks Location
The system validates the student’s GPS location to confirm they are in class.
Backend Signs Attendance Data
Instead of requiring students to have a crypto wallet, the backend digitally signs attendance using a stored private key.
Record is Stored on Blockchain
The signed attendance data is permanently added to the blockchain.
Admin Can Verify Records
Teachers and admins can view attendance logs securely through a dashboard.
How Does Blockchain Prevent Cheating?
Problem	How Blockchain Fixes It
Students share QR codes with absent friends	Attendance is only recorded if the student's GPS location is verified.
Students manually edit attendance records	Attendance is stored on the blockchain, making it tamper-proof.
Admins or teachers manipulate records	Every record is publicly verifiable on the blockchain.
Fake attendance submissions	Attendance is digitally signed and authenticated before being added.


### Problems We Have Right Now
QR Code Sharing – Students can share QR codes with absent peers.
No Proof of Presence – Just scanning a QR code doesn’t prove the student is physically there.
Manual Tampering – An admin or teacher could edit attendance records.
Identity Fraud – A friend could scan the code for an absent student.
Lack of Transparency – Students can’t independently verify their attendance logs.
Use Cases & Real-World Scenarios
Preventing QR Code Sharing:
Scenario: Student A shares the QR with Student B at home.
Solution: Use GPS-based geofencing to allow check-ins only inside the classroom.
Stopping Manual Tampering:
Scenario: Admin changes attendance records after class.
Solution: Blockchain ensures records are immutable, so no one can alter them.
Ensuring Identity Verification:
Scenario: Student A asks Student B to scan on their behalf.
Solution: Use biometric authentication (face/fingerprint scan).
Providing Transparent Records:
Scenario: A student claims they attended, but the system marked them absent.
Solution: Attendance data is publicly verifiable on the blockchain.
Automating Attendance:
Scenario: A professor doesn’t want to manually check attendance.
Solution: QR scan → GPS verified → Data written to blockchain automatically.
